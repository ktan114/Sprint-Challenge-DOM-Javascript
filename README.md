# Assessing your Vanilla JS DOM Manipulation Fu
* Answers to your written questions will be recorded in *Answers.md* 
* This is to be worked on alone but you can use outside resources. You can *reference* any old code you may have, and documentation, however, please refrain from copying and pasting any of your answers. Try and understand the question and put your responses in your own words.

## Questions
1. What is the DOM?
2. What is an event?
3. What is an event listener?
4. What is a Constructor

## Challenge
Your Challenge is to make a simple `Button` component that hides when it's clicked. There will be three instances in the html. Make sure to give it a little styling of your own.

## Stretch Challenge
Your stretch challenge is to write the functionality of a `Carousel` component. You have the HTML and CSS already in place. This is an advanced challenge, so you are not expected to be able to complete it. If you begin and don't finish, you should still submit with what you have. You may reference the `Tabs` component for assistance.
